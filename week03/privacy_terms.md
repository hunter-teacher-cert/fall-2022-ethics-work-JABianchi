# COMPARISON OF TWO PRIVACY POLICIES

* [Arduino Web Editor](https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy) - the official online web editor for the Arduino platform
* [Codebender](https://codebender.cc/static/privacy_policy#:~:text=PERSONAL%20INFORMATION%20WE%20COLLECT,are%20installed%20on%20your%20device.) - the original (and now revised) online web editor for the Arduino platform

### Policies for Students:
* Both platforms share a lot of the same information gathered and shared with 3rd parties for advertising purposes.  However, the biggest difference that concerns me is the policy for minors.
* Arduino Web Editor has a separate privacy policy for middle school children and younger (under 14 years old).  No identifying student data is processed, and teachers can manage logins with unique usernames and pictorial passwords.  Older students would seemingly have the same privacy protections as all general users.
* Codebender’s site is “not intended for individuals under 18 without parental permission”.  However, they do offer  student licenses.  (There is not a separate Minor’s policy posted.)
* I like how Arduino Web Editor has created “Junior Accounts” for younger students, but wish they would extend those protections to older students.  Codebender gets around this legally by having parents sign away students rights, while most probably aren’t reading the fine print about how they’re collecting other cookie data on the computers and share with third parties!


### Data Collection:
* Codebender collects cookie information from OTHER platforms, and stores all data entered on the site, including web browser, IP address, time zone.
* Arduino’s general accounts also collect all user-entered data, and IP address, OS versions, and browser types.

### Sharing Data:
* Codebender shares data with Google Analytics (buy you can opt-out), law enforcement, and targeted advertising from Facebook, Google, Bing, and others that are part of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“AdChoice”).
Arduino Web Editor also shares information with Google Analytics & Meta Events Manager, Zapier (identifying information), Google Fonts, Hotjar Heat Maps, Contentful, AWS, Algolia, Google Cloud Storage, Zendesk, Mailgun, Shopify, Github, Apple, Auth0
* Arduino also uses “behavioral targeting features” like AdChoice and shares your information with its “commercial partners”, but this can be opted out of.
