The New York City public school district is the largest in the country. Unlike most other districts, there is no specified path for any student going from middle school to high school; that is, students are not assigned a high school based on their location. Rather, students are “matched” with a high school through a ranking system. For our project, we explored the algorithm used to match New York City middle school students to New York City high schools.

NYC middle school students are tasked with ranking the top high schools they would like to attend. Meanwhile, high schools must rank the middle school students that they would like to attend their school. These rankings are then placed into an algorithm; students are told which high school they matched with and high schools are given a roster of students. This algorithm closely resembles the stable marriage problem. In the stable marriage problem, parties are matched together; the algorithm is complete when no two parties that would prefer to be with each other over their current partner exist.

High schools rank students based solely on academic criteria, such as math scores, reading scores, and attendance. They do not consider factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, or socio-economic background. Students, meanwhile, base their rankings on personal preference and knowledge of the high schools. Similar to the college application process, students’ preferences may be heavily influenced by their access to and/or knowledgeability of their guidance counselor. A knowledge guidance counselor who knows the student personally, for example, may be better able to advise the student on strategic rankings. A guidance counselor without such knowledge may be less helpful.
